# monopolypy
Text-based Monopoly made with Python

## Background
I made this to solidify my knowledge with Python, and to see an idea go from a thought in my head to a fully-working project.<br><br>
There isn't really any demand for text-based Monopoly, and for good reason, but this was a personal project to test my coding ability that I'm pretty content with.
